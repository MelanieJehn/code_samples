## sfm_autoencoder
A python project on 3D model reconstruction from a series of images.

## neural_networks
Homeworks for the course NNDL. Homework 1 focuses on supervised learning and homework 2 on unsupervised learning and generative models. I include for each homework the jupyter notebook containing the code as well as a report explaining the results. Also programmed in Python and using PyTorch.

## robot_learning
A project on Multi-modal Attention for Human-Robot Interaction. Contains only my part of the project, programmed in Python. The project is a catkin workspace and communication with other parts of the project was implemented using ROS servers. I implemented Automatic Speech Recognition, the Classifier and the Context Network.
